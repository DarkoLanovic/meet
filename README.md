FEATURE 3: SPECIFY NUMBER OF EVENTS

“As a user, I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once.”

Scenario 1: When user hasn’t specified a number, 32 is the default number.

    Given: the user hasn’t specified the number of events
